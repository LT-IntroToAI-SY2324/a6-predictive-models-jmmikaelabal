# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
    My R squared coefficient is .85, this means that my data can be represented well throughout my model.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
My model is accurate because the R square value is close to 1.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
8983.56 dollars; 1912.18 dollars
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening? 
The older the car, the more miles it would have. This also means it decreases in value. I think that is why it leads to negative values for some of my predicted results.
