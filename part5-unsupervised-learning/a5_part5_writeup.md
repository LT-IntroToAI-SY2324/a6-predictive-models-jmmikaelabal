## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
Low income and low spending score- "savers"
low annual income and high spenders- "wasters"
medium annual income and medium spending score- "thrifters"
high annual income and high spending score- "luxurious"
high annual income and low spending score- "sparing"
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
A customer who has medium income and low spending habits would be around the thrifters and sparing group
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
The cluster that interests me the most would have to be high annual income and high spending score. I think the marketing team would approach this speific customer group by trying to sell more luxurious items to these customers and higlighting the pricier and more valuable items since high spenders with high income can most likely afford the items
